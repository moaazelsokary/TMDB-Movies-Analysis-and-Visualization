# TMDB-Movies-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project has two parts of visualizing our data. In the first part, we will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, we will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that we discovered in our selected dataset.
